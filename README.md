An Android app created using java and xml. for data storage and mobile number authentication used firebase. Any one can login using their phone number on this app and start chatting with their favourite one.tried to create a very simple and engaging ui 

Baatcheet is a simple messaging App which is created by me using java , xml and android studio. It is  capable to send and receive message using mobile internet. Our App is similar  to WhatsApp but our USP is you can add reaction on any messages sent or receive by you.

Our App is compatible with devices running on Android jelly bean or above jelly bean android version.

For backend technology I uses firebase which is managed by google. It is highly secured and having developer friendly interface. It fetches real time data to it is very useful in real time messaging app.
